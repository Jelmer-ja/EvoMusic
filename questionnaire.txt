To take part in this short study you will watch short video where you will listen to a number
of short melodies. While listening to the melodies a number will be displayed on the screen. 
Please rate each of the melodies on a scale from 1 to 7. Where 1 means that the melody was awful 
to listen to and 7 means that the melody was very pleasant to listen to.

When sending back this questionnaire you give consent that we can analyze and publish the collected data for scientific purposes. 
All data will be anonymous and no information other than the rating of the melodies will be collected.

Best regards,
Jelmer Jansen and Tristan Payer
